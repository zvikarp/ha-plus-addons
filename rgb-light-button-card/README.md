## Compatibility

This card works with any Home Assistant light entity that supports:
- Basic on/off control

- Cheap AliExpress RGB LED strips
- Tuya-based RGB lights

## Tips

1. **Check your light's supported effects**: Use Developer Tools > States to see what effects your light supports, then configure them in the card
2. **Adjust columns for mobile**: Use fewer columns (2-3) for better mobile display
3. **Hide unused features**: Set `show_brightness: false` or `show_effects: false` if your light doesn't support them
4. **Multiple cards for multiple lights**: Create separate card instances for different lights with different configurations

## Troubleshooting

### Card doesn't appear
- Make sure you've added the resource to `configuration.yaml`
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
- Check the browser console for errors

### Colors don't match
- RGB values must be 0-255
- Check that your light entity supports `rgb_color` service calls

### Effects don't work
- Check your light's supported effects in Developer Tools
- Make sure the effect names match what your light supports
- Some cheap lights may not support all effects
