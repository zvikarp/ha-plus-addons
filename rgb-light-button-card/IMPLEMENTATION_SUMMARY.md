# Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Repository Rebranding (Add-ons → Apps)

As requested, the repository has been updated to reflect Home Assistant's terminology change from "Add-ons" to "Apps":

- **README.md**: Changed "Home Assistant Add-ons" to "Home Assistant Apps"
- **repository.yaml**: Changed "HA Plus Add-ons" to "HA Plus Apps"

Technical references (like `addon_config` in config files) were intentionally left unchanged as these are Home Assistant system identifiers that should not be modified.

### 2. New RGB Light Button Card Component

A complete custom Lovelace card has been implemented for controlling RGB lights with preset color buttons. This is perfect for cheap AliExpress RGB LED strips that don't need full color wheel control.

## What is the RGB Light Button Card?

The RGB Light Button Card is a **custom Lovelace card** (not a Home Assistant App/Add-on). It's a frontend UI component that adds a new type of card to your Home Assistant dashboards.

### Key Features

1. **Preset Color Buttons**: 12 default colors based on typical cheap LED remotes
   - Red, Green, Blue, White
   - Orange, Cyan, Purple, Yellow
   - Pink, Lime, Magenta, Warm White

2. **Effect Controls**: 4 default effects
   - Flash
   - Strobe
   - Fade
   - Smooth

3. **Brightness Control**: Slider for adjusting brightness (0-100%)

4. **Power Toggle**: Simple ON/OFF button

5. **Fully Configurable**: Every aspect can be customized per light instance:
   - Custom colors with RGB values
   - Custom effect names and types
   - Number of color button columns
   - Show/hide brightness slider
   - Show/hide effects section
   - Card title

## Component Type: Custom Lovelace Card vs Home Assistant App

### Important Distinction

**This is a Custom Lovelace Card, NOT a Home Assistant App (Add-on)**

| Aspect | Home Assistant Apps | Custom Lovelace Cards |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Type** | Backend services | Frontend UI components |
| **Runs on** | Server (Docker containers) | Browser (JavaScript) |
| **Installation** | Add-on Store (HA OS/Supervised) | Manual or HACS |
| **Purpose** | Services, integrations, backends | Dashboard cards, UI elements |
| **Examples** | Matter Hub, ESPHome, Zigbee2MQTT | Button Card, Mushroom Cards |
| **Access** | Supervisor → Apps | Lovelace → Add Card |

### Why This is a Card, Not an App

The RGB Light Button Card is a frontend component because:
1. It only provides UI controls in dashboards
2. It doesn't run any backend services
3. It interacts with existing Home Assistant light entities
4. It's implemented in JavaScript and runs in your browser

## Installation Location

The RGB Light Button Card is implemented in the `rgb-light-button-card/` folder with the following structure:

```
rgb-light-button-card/
├── rgb-light-button-card.js     # Main card implementation
├── README.md                     # Full documentation
├── INSTALLATION.md               # Detailed installation guide
├── example-config.yaml           # Configuration examples
├── info.md                       # Short description for HACS
├── hacs.json                     # HACS integration config
└── package.json                  # NPM package metadata
```

## How to Install and Use

### Installation Methods

There are two main ways to install this card:

#### Method 1: Manual Installation (Simplest)

1. Copy `rgb-light-button-card.js` to `/config/www/` in Home Assistant
2. Add resource in Settings → Dashboards → Resources:
   - URL: `/local/rgb-light-button-card.js`
   - Type: JavaScript Module
3. Restart Home Assistant and clear browser cache
4. Add card to dashboard with entity: `light.your_rgb_light`

#### Method 2: HACS (When in separate repository)

For easier distribution through HACS, you should:
1. Copy the entire `rgb-light-button-card/` folder to its own GitHub repository
2. Submit to HACS default repository list
3. Users can then install via HACS → Frontend

See `INSTALLATION.md` for detailed step-by-step instructions.

## Basic Usage

### Simple Configuration

```yaml
type: custom:rgb-light-button-card
entity: light.bedroom_led_strip
```

### Full Configuration

```yaml
type: custom:rgb-light-button-card
entity: light.bedroom_led_strip
title: Bedroom RGB Strip
show_brightness: true
show_effects: true
columns: 4
colors:
  - name: Red
    rgb: [255, 0, 0]
  - name: Green
    rgb: [0, 255, 0]
  - name: Blue
    rgb: [0, 0, 255]
  # ... more colors
effects:
  - name: Flash
    effect: flash
  - name: Strobe
    effect: strobe
  # ... more effects
```

## Recommendation: Separate Repository

As you mentioned, it would be appropriate to move this to its own repository for several reasons:

### Benefits of Separate Repository

1. **HACS Integration**: Easier to submit to HACS as a plugin
2. **Versioning**: Independent version control and releases
3. **Issues**: Separate issue tracking for the card
4. **Documentation**: Focused documentation without mixing with apps
5. **Users**: Easier for users to find and star the specific component

### How to Create Separate Repository

1. Create a new GitHub repository named `rgb-light-button-card`
2. Copy the entire `rgb-light-button-card/` folder contents to the root
3. Add a `.gitignore` and `LICENSE` file
4. Create releases/tags for versioning
5. Submit to HACS default repository list

The folder structure is already set up to be copy-pasted as-is to a new repository root.

## Testing the Card

Since this is a frontend component, testing requires:

1. A running Home Assistant instance
2. At least one RGB light entity
3. A browser to view the dashboard

### Manual Testing Steps

1. Install the card using manual method
2. Create a test dashboard
3. Add the card with a real light entity
4. Test features:
   - Power toggle
   - Color buttons
   - Brightness slider
   - Effect buttons (if your light supports effects)

## Compatibility

Works with any Home Assistant light entity that supports:
- Basic on/off control (all lights)
- RGB color control via `rgb_color` service (RGB lights)
- Brightness control (dimmable lights)
- Effects (lights with effect support)

### Compatible Devices

- ✅ Cheap AliExpress RGB LED strips
- ✅ Tuya-based RGB lights  
- ✅ ESPHome RGB lights
